# Palwish - 3D Raycasting Game Engine

A multiplayer first-person shooter game engine written in C using CSFML, featuring raycasting technology similar to classic games like Wolfenstein 3D.

## Features

- First-person 3D perspective using raycasting
- Multiplayer capabilities with client-server architecture
- Real-time network synchronization
- Multiple weapons system (AK47, Minigun)
- Smooth player movement and rotation
- Real-time rendered minimap with player tracking
- Procedurally generated maps
- Advanced collision detection
- Textured walls, floor, and ceiling
- Mouse and gamepad support
- Health and stamina systems
- Weapon reloading mechanics
- Performance statistics display

## Prerequisites

- GCC compiler
- CSFML library
- Make
- Network connectivity (for multiplayer)

## Building

To build the project:
```bash
